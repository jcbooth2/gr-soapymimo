This is an application of using the SoapySDR client API to implement multi-input multi-output (MIMO) antenna communication systems in GNU Radio. I plan on making both a source and sink that can utilize multiple types of commercially avaliable SDR boards as a phased array. This repository is currently under development and not ready for general use. If you have any suggestions or comments please contact me.
