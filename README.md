# gr-soapymimo
This is an application of using the SoapySDR client API to implement multi-input multi-output (MIMO) antenna communication systems in GNU Radio. This repository is currently under development and not ready for general use. I plan on implementing both a general MIMO source and sink as well as a phased array MIMO source and sink.
